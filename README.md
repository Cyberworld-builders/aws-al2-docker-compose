# AWS Amazon Linux 2 Docker Compose LAMP Stack

This is a legacy stack. It is meant for an app that runs on CodeIgniter 2. That means it has to run PHP 5. 
It gets better. The app is maintained by a Bitnami installation of a WAMP stack on a Windows Server instance.
As you would expect, the app has no automated test coverage either. So this may be a fool's errand. But the 
idea is to port this whole system over to linux and automate the stack inside of Docker containers. You almost
certainly will not ever need this and if you do, God help you. Run. 

Really the only reason I'm bothering to write this is because I'm trying to clean up my repositories and I 
felt like this needed explanation. I'll leave it up for posterity and historical purposes but not without some
attitude and grumbling.

Oh and my excuse is that it will give me good experience with multi-regional infrastructure and the dockerization
of a high traffic production product. BUT THIS IS THE LAST TIME I WORK ON TECH THIS LEGACY, I ASSURE YOU!
